# React-Yankee

This react project is inspired by a website created for a Red Dead Redemption clan that I was part of. The initial website was made by a clan member and he made the website using wix in 2013. My inspiration was purely nostalgic, and the idea of remake the website is just to remind a very good time playing games with friends.

# Disclaimer

The idea of Yankees is just for role-playing, the members of the clan do not agree with any of the racism attitudes made by yankees. The purpose of the clan is just for interpret the yankees in multplayer mode of Read Dead.
